        Our afterschool programs offer something for every child — from creative arts and hands-on STEM adventures 
        to sports, music, and community service. Students can explore new passions, build lasting friendships, and 
        develop confidence in a fun, supportive environment. Whether your child loves coding, painting, or playing 
        on the field, our afterschool activities turn every afternoon into an opportunity to learn, laugh, and shine!
